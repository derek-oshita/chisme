## Overview

During our boot camp at GA, we were given a unique project opportunity to collaborate with a sister UX/UI design cohort. This project was a 36-hour sprint that focused on collaboration across departments and an emphasis on a client-specific industry. We were tasked with "celebrity gossip." 

The goal of the project was to design and create a landing page for our client. Our designers utilized white-space, bright colors, and a hero-image/article at the forefront of our landing page to emmulate the feel of a "celebrity gossip" news outlet.

The project also provides a dashboard from our client's perspective if one were to fill out and submit their information on the form at the bottom of the landing page. From the dashboard view, our client can view and track all of the users that subscribe to Chisme to help them drive business decisions.
